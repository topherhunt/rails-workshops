# Rails / web dev course

This readme is a WIP collection of notes on the course.

It will probably contain:

  - Vagrantfile / init script
  - Cheatsheets for students, incl:
    - Getting set up / terminal basics / using Vagrant
    - Rails basics
    - Git & Github cheatsheet
    - Heroku deployment cheatsheet
  - Guides (ie. each course module)

Deployed using Github Pages.

## Structure

  * Minimize duplication. Minimize rewriting stuff that's already out there. eg. use the official Rails guide, and reference existing cheatsheets instead of writing my own new ones.
  * The goal is to produce successful modular workshops, not a book.
  * Each workshop has its own numbered/named folder under `modules/`, such as `01_rails_intro/`. That folder contains a file `_outline.md`, which has the full outline for this module. The folder can also contain supporting documents to link to.
  * Globally relevant help material can go in `/help/`, but be very stingy about what I write here! For the most part I can link out to more official guides rather than writing new worse ones.


## Considerations when designing modules

  * Clear statement of requirements at top. Where possible, provide links to what students can do to "catch up" in case they lack a prerequisite. Where possible, minimize requirements, so the maximum breadth of students can get value out of it.
  * Flexible, so sharp students can keep themselves busy learning deeper material while others catch up. Each task should have a "basic" version and an "extra credit" version. The goal is to maximize the opportunity for both novices and near-experts to be in the same room, participating in the same activity, and both deriving comparable value out of the event.
  * Easy to flow into the next module, in case it was too easy / short
  * Segmented / easy to zoom in and focus on just the first section, in case it was way too hard / long
  * Target length: 2 focused hours.
