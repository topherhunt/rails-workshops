# Intro

This is the support material for an intro web development workshop using Ruby on Rails. Please

## What you'll learn

This workshop will introduce you to a _lot_ of basic web development concepts. Some you might already be familiar with. Some might be really hard to pick up and that's OK, you don't need to get everything, but please do [sent me feedback - TODO](#) about anything that was hard for you or anything you'd like to be different about this course.

In this workshop, you'll learn about:

  * Basics of the Ruby language
  * Basic features & structure of the Rails framework, how to navigate around a Rails project, what the important pieces do
  * ??? TODO


## Requirements

The workshop assumes that the following are all true for you:

  * You have a laptop with >= 15 GB free disk space and >= 1.5 GB free memory. It can be Windows, Linux, or Mac. We'll use a program called Vagrant to set up a virtual environment inside your computer so that we don't spend the whole time fighting installation problems.
  * You're comfortable using the Terminal (aka Command Line) to change directory and run basic commands. (If not: read and follow along with the basic intro guide for your OS: [Mac](https://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/utilities-how-to/how-to-use-terminal-the-basics/) or [Windows](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm))
  * You have experience doing programming in _some_ lanuage, e.g. PHP or C. (If not: Spend a few hours on the [Ruby Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/) tutorial, ideally get at least to exercise 15 ("about_exceptions.rb") and that will give you a good starting point for this workshop.)
  * You're familiar with the basic concepts of a web browser, webserver, HTTP request, HTML page, and how these are related. (If not: skim the first 5 pages of [this article](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/web-page.htm).)
  * You'd find it neat to learn web development superpowers, and then use those superpowers to improve the world in some way.

You do NOT need to be familiar with:

  * Ruby
  * Rails
  * Webserver architecture concepts like MVC


## Setup BEFORE the workshop

Please do the following **at least 2 days before** the workshop starts. The install steps will vary based on your computer OS and how it's set up. If you run into problems, search Google for a solution, or email me [TODO: ref] and I'll be glad to help. The goal is that everyone has the Vagrant environment set up so that in the workshop we can dive right into the interesting stuff.
